# TLDR
    Create a folder, lets call it the root folder. THe root folder contains all files you call organized. Outside the root, all files are (mostly) unorganized. In the root folder, organize you files into idea folders and cateogries folders.
    The root folder is a what I will call a mixed idea folder. It contains both idea folders and category folders. A mixed idea folder has just one rule, don't make two folders tha hold the same kind of files. More on what an idea folder to come.
    In an idea folder can contain a mess of files, pure idea folders, pure category folders, or a mix of both category and idea folders. It's up to you to decide when. Be flexable.
    Your files are going to vary greatly , prompting you to need many different folders to organize your files. If you require an ocean of folders to home your files, its best to embrase the messyness. Often times, it's better to have an ocean of ideas rather than an ocean of categories.

# Terminology
Sorry about the technical looking table below. I don't like turning blogs into documentation but this table will make every thing in this post more clear.
| Term | Explanation |
| :--- | :--- |
| Root folder | The top most level of your organization scheme. I assume you have only 1 folder that contains the organizaion scheme in this blog. |
| Current folder | The folder that I am talking about in any given moment in this blog |
| Parent folder | The folder that the current folder is in |
| Child folder | The folders that are in the current folder |
| File | A set of folders and files, files are objects you, your computer, and your network interact with |
| folder | A file that contains a set of folder inside of it |

# The Issue with most organizaion schemes
    Most folder organizatioin schemes try to do the equivalent of sortin every leaf in a forest floor by it's color. What happons is that you end up with an unmanageable set of leaf files spread out all over the places. You can't find the red leaf piles or green leaf files because the sum of all piles piles span a mile in length. When you take a look at any particular leaf pile, you are conflicted on weather or not you should move a few leafs from that pile and put it into another pile because those leafs look slighly more red than the others. This is the same mess you run into when you try to organize your files purly by category. 
    I'm going to start picking on the conventional Unreal Engine organizion for a liitle. Lets look at the project folder in Unreal as an example. In this folder, it contains a folder called Art, blueprints (they are scripts), Audio Core, Maps, and it goes on. It seems to make sence at first. You put your character models in the Art folder, you put the maps / levels in the maps folder, you put the character controller blueprint in the blueprint folder. Wait, no you put that file in the core folder. I'm not sure. You put sound que manager asset into the the audio folder but wait, it gets placed down in the map so perhaps it should go into the map folder but it's a core mmanager to the game so mayby it goes into core but it's a blueprint so it goes into blueprints. It's caos. 
    Traditional category based organizaion is meant to help you know where to put files and folders but ends often times will end up resulting in you and your team just having to memorize or feel around for where a specific file is. To be honast, I can't say I know how to fix this issue. I don't know how to create a system that you follow that will get you to the file in a teterministic way. What I do know of is perhpas the best way to feel around to find your files

# The solution
    You need to embrase the fact that finding things is hard to find and not kid yourself. Loosen up your rules on categories and allow for some folders to be just ideas. An idea can be the name of a project your working on, it can be a category in witch you don't plan to be that strict on
